## Project introduction
LaumenServerFramework is a class library containing reusable elements for other server projects within the Laumen Suite Server.
The goal is to reduce code duplication and hence reduce development time.
This project is not runnable on its own.
This single project contains all code of the Laumen Server Framework, no matter the type.
